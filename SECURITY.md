# Security policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes go into the latest release. Please update before reporting.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub's
[private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/rennerdo30/pair-desk/security/advisories/new)
("Report a vulnerability" on the Security tab). Do not open a public issue.

Include what you found, how to reproduce it, the version (`python desk.py --version`) and your
operating system. You can expect a first answer within a week. Once a fix is released, the
advisory is published and you are credited unless you prefer otherwise.

## Security model

Pair Desk is a local tool. Its design assumptions:

- **Loopback only by default.** `serve` binds `127.0.0.1`. Requests from non-loopback addresses,
  with a non-loopback `Host` header, or with a browser `Origin` other than the desk's own
  (`http://127.0.0.1[:port]`, `http://localhost[:port]`, or `null`) get `403`. This blocks other
  machines, DNS rebinding and cross-site requests from web pages you visit. Writes (POST, PATCH,
  DELETE) are also refused from a `null` Origin (a sandboxed frame of any site) and from requests
  the browser marks `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site`.
- **Opening a build's folder and running its player** (`/build/open`, `/build/run`) act only on a
  path the desk stored, never on one from the request. They need a loopback client (also with
  `--lan`), a same-origin request and the per-server token the desk writes into the page it serves
  (sent as `X-Pair-Desk-Token`, which a foreign page cannot send without a CORS preflight the desk
  refuses). Run starts the executable without a shell and without arguments. No MCP tool starts
  anything.
- **No authentication.** Anything running on your machine as any user that can reach
  `127.0.0.1` can read and write the desk. That is the intended trust boundary.
- **`--lan` removes the network restriction** and still has no authentication: anyone on the
  network can read, change and delete issues and attachments, and queue commands for your game.
  Use it only on a network you trust, and stop the desk afterwards.
- **Commands for the game** are text the owner or an agent queued; the game decides what to run.
  Games should only accept their own console commands from the desk.
- **The HTTP API never reads local files.** Attachment paths are accepted only from the CLI and
  the MCP server (local processes), limited to image and PDF types and checked by content.
- **Uploaded files are served with their sniffed type**; only images, video, PDF and plain text
  open inline, everything else downloads. HTML in markdown is always escaped, and the UI is
  served with a strict Content Security Policy.
- **The installers edit other tools' configuration** (Codex's `config.toml`, opencode's config,
  `~/.agents/skills`) only in their own `pair-desk` entries, after a timestamped backup.

Reports that need a non-default setup (`--lan`, a hostile local user) are still welcome; say so
in the report.
